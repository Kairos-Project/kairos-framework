* **Reusable and Modular Code** : Whether you come from the android developer world, you are in the right place. Improve your JavaFX apps using Activities and Fragments

## Installing Kairos

Kairos utilizes Gradle to manage its dependencies and enhance the development tasks. If you are using Gradle you must replace one line of code in the top of your **build.gradle**

```gradle
apply plugin: 'java'

```
To

```gradle
apply from: 'http://dl.bintray.com/content/shemnon/javafx-gradle/8.1.1/javafx.plugin'
apply plugin:'maven'
```
Thanks to shemnon to provide this amazing gradle plugin.

### Gradle Installation (Gradle Repository)

First you need add JitPack in the gradle repositories. 

```gradle
repositories {
   maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
   mavenCentral()
}
```

Finally add the framework to the gradle dependencies

```gradle
dependencies {
   compile 'com.github.Kairos-Project:kairos-framework:0.5.1'
}
```

### Gradle Installation (With JAR)

Download the Jar Library and add in the gradle dependencies

https://github.com/Kairos-Project/kairos-framework/releases/download/0.5/kairos-all-0.5.jar

I had to create a folder called libs in the root of the project but you can choose any name, then place the jar inside of the folder and add the next dependency in gradle.

```gradle
dependencies {
   compile files ('libs/kairos-all-0.5.jar')
}
```

## Installing with IDE
Using the default build tool of your favorite IDE the process could be different. But don't worry if in the past you had installed another java library , the process is the same.
	
### Intellij IDE
